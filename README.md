# Generate-SteamApp-Shortcuts
Reads your app manifest from inside of your steamapps folder, and loops through it, creating shortcuts for all of your present games.


Place the contents inside of your SteamApps folder, then run the executable.  You will be prompted with a finished message when the generation is complete.
The generated shortcuts will be placed in a folder inside of the steamapps folder, called "gen".
